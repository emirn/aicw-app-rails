Write Documentation First\n\nBefore coding, write what your function should do. This clarifies your thinking and produces better code.\n\n## 5. Embrace Code Reviews\n\nCode reviews help you:\n\n- Learn new techniques\n- Catch bugs early\n- Share knowledge\n\n## 6. Limit Context Switching\n\nBatching similar tasks reduces mental overhead:\n\n| Task Type | Best Time |\n|-----------|------------|\n| Deep work | Morning |\n| Meetings | Afternoon |\n| Email | Specific blocks |\n\n## 7. Use Version Control Effectively\n\nCommit often with meaningful messages. Your future self will thank you.\n\n## 8. Take Real Breaks\n\nStep away from the screen. Walk, stretch, or just look outside.\n\n## 9. Build a Second Brain\n\nDocument solutions you find. Use tools like:\n\n- Notion\n- Obsidian\n- Simple markdown files\n\n## 10.
