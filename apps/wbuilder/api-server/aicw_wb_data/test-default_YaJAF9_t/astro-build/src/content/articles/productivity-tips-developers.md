# 10 Productivity Tips for Developers

Maximizing your productivity as a developer isn't about working more hours—it's about working smarter. Here are ten proven strategies to help you code more efficiently.

## 1. Master Your IDE

Learn keyboard shortcuts for your editor. Even saving 2 seconds per action adds up over a day of coding.

### Essential Shortcuts

- `Cmd/Ctrl + P`: Quick file open
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + F`: Global search
- `F2`: Rename symbol
- `Cmd/Ctrl + D`: Select next occurrence

## 2. Use the Pomodoro Technique

Work in focused 25-minute blocks:

1. Choose a task
2. Work for 25 minutes
3. Take a 5-minute break
4. Repeat

## 3. Automate Repetitive Tasks

```bash
# Example: Git commit automation
alias gcp='git add -A && git commit -m'
alias gpush='git push origin $(git branch --show-current)'
```

## 4. Write Documentation First

Before coding, write what your function should do. This clarifies your thinking and produces better code.

## 5. Embrace Code Reviews

Code reviews help you:

- Learn new techniques
- Catch bugs early
- Share knowledge

## 6. Limit Context Switching

Batching similar tasks reduces mental overhead:

| Task Type | Best Time |
|-----------|------------|
| Deep work | Morning |
| Meetings | Afternoon |
| Email | Specific blocks |

## 7. Use Version Control Effectively

Commit often with meaningful messages. Your future self will thank you.

## 8. Take Real Breaks

Step away from the screen. Walk, stretch, or just look outside.

## 9. Build a Second Brain

Document solutions you find. Use tools like:

- Notion
- Obsidian
- Simple markdown files

## 10. Invest in Your Setup

Good equipment reduces friction:

- Multiple monitors
- Mechanical keyboard
- Ergonomic chair

## Conclusion

Productivity is a skill that improves with practice. Start with one tip this week and gradually incorporate more into your routine.
