# Top Web Development Trends in 2025

The web development landscape is constantly evolving. Let's explore the most impactful trends shaping how we build for the web this year.

## 1. AI-Powered Development Tools

AI is revolutionizing how developers write code. Tools like Claude and Copilot are now standard in most development workflows.

### Key Features

- Intelligent code completion
- Automated bug detection
- Documentation generation

## 2. Edge Computing Goes Mainstream

More applications are leveraging edge computing for:

- Reduced latency
- Better user experiences
- Lower hosting costs

```javascript
// Edge function example
export default {
  async fetch(request) {
    const country = request.headers.get('cf-ipcountry');
    return new Response(`Hello from ${country}!`);
  }
}
```

## 3. WebAssembly Adoption

WASM is enabling high-performance applications in the browser:

| Use Case | Performance Gain |
|----------|------------------|
| Image processing | 10x faster |
| Video encoding | 5x faster |
| Gaming | Near-native |

## 4. Serverless Architecture

The serverless paradigm continues to grow:

1. **Function as a Service**: Run code without managing servers
2. **Database as a Service**: Scalable data storage
3. **Auth as a Service**: Simplified user management

## Conclusion

Stay curious and keep learning. The web development field rewards those who embrace change and continuously update their skills.
