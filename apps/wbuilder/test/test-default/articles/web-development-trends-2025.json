Let's explore the most impactful trends shaping how we build for the web this year.\n\n## 1. AI-Powered Development Tools\n\nAI is revolutionizing how developers write code. Tools like Claude and Copilot are now standard in most development workflows.\n\n### Key Features\n\n- Intelligent code completion\n- Automated bug detection\n- Documentation generation\n\n## 2. Edge Computing Goes Mainstream\n\nMore applications are leveraging edge computing for:\n\n- Reduced latency\n- Better user experiences\n- Lower hosting costs\n\n```javascript\n// Edge function example\nexport default {\n  async fetch(request) {\n    const country = request.headers.get('cf-ipcountry');\n    return new Response(`Hello from ${country}!`);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## 3. WebAssembly Adoption\n\nWASM is enabling high-performance applications in the browser:\n\n| Use Case | Performance Gain |\n|----------|------------------|\n| Image processing | 10x faster |\n| Video encoding | 5x faster |\n| Gaming | Near-native |\n\n## 4. Serverless Architecture\n\nThe serverless paradigm continues to grow:\n\n1. **Function as a Service**: Run code without managing servers\n2. **Database as a Service**: Scalable data storage\n3. **Auth as a Service**: Simplified user management\n\n## Conclusion\n\nStay curious and keep learning. The web development field rewards those who embrace change and continuously update their skills."
