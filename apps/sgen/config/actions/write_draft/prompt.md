## Pre-defined Article Metadata

Generate content for THIS specific article:
- **Title**: {{article_title}}
- **Target Keywords**: {{article_keywords}}
- **Meta Description**: {{article_description}}

IMPORTANT:
- Use the exact title above when referencing the article topic
- Naturally incorporate the target keywords throughout the content
- Do NOT include the title as an H1 heading (# Title) in your response - the title is stored separately in metadata. Do NOT use H1 heading (or markdown # Title) in your response.
- Start your content with ## (H2) sections, not # (H1)

## AI Visibility & Content Structure Guidelines

Follow these content structuring rules to maximize both reader value and AI citation probability:

### Answer-First Formatting
Begin each H2 section with a direct 1-2 sentence answer to the section topic before elaborating. The first paragraph under each heading should be self-sufficient — a reader (or AI) should get the key takeaway without reading further.

### TL;DR Summary Block
Begin the article with a 2-3 sentence summary block formatted as a blockquote (> ) that captures the key takeaway. This acts as a TL;DR for both readers and AI systems.

### Inline Source Citations
Include 3-5 inline citations to authoritative sources throughout the article using the format "according to [Source Name]" or "a [Year] [Source] study found". Reference specific organizations, studies, or publications by name even without URLs — the external linking action will add hyperlinks later.

### Self-Contained Paragraphs
Structure each paragraph as a self-contained unit of 50-150 words. Each paragraph should convey one complete idea that makes sense if extracted in isolation. Avoid paragraphs that begin with "This..." or "It..." referring to the previous paragraph.

### Semantic Cue Words
Use explicit semantic markers at transition points: "The key takeaway is...", "In practice, this means...", "The most important factor is...". These signals help AI systems identify and extract the most relevant content.

### Tables
Include at least one markdown comparison or data table where the topic allows it (e.g., feature comparison, pros/cons, specifications). Use proper markdown table syntax with header row — AI systems cite tabular data significantly more often.

### Lists
Include at least 2 bulleted or numbered list sections where information can be broken into discrete items (steps, features, tips, requirements). Lists are strongly correlated with AI citation selection.

### Entity Density
Reference at least 10-15 named entities throughout the article — specific companies, products, people, technologies, standards, or organizations relevant to the topic. Named entities help AI systems classify and cite content.
