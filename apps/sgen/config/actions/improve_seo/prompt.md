- Use meaningful H2/H3 structure; add a short summary or TL;DR if missing.
- Add internal anchors where helpful; keep links descriptive.
- Do NOT add any kind of additional sections like FAQ, TOC or similar
- Improve readability (short paragraphs, lists, active voice) without changing meaning and wording, just reformat the text like breaking into a list of paragraphs or sentences or making sentence into multiple sentences.
