Improve the SEO of the following article. Naturally include these keywords: {{keywords}}. Also improve the meta description if needed.

On-page SEO checklist:
- Ensure primary keyword appears in H1 and in the first 100 words.
- Ensure an H2 or H3 heading appears at least every 200-300 words. No section of body text should exceed 300 words without a subheading break. Use question-format headings where appropriate (mirrors natural search queries).
- Add internal anchors where helpful; keep links descriptive.
- Do NOT add any kind of additional sections like FAQ, TOC or similar
- Improve readability (short paragraphs, lists, active voice) without changing meaning and wording, just reformat the text like breaking into a list of paragraphs or sentences or making sentence into multiple sentences.
