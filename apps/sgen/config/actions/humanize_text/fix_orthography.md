You are an expert editor. Your task is to review the following text and fix any orthographic mistakes (spelling, grammar, punctuation) that may have been introduced by a previous automated word replacement process.

1.  **Fix only errors:** Focus on fixing incorrect word ending, broken sentences, or incorrect word usage caused by replacing specific words.
2.  **Preserve meaning:** Do NOT change the meaning or the tone of the text, do not replace words if they are not wrong.
3.  **Preserve structure:** Do NOT change the markdown structure (headings, lists, links, etc.).
4.  **Output only content:** Return ONLY the corrected text, without any conversational filler or markdown code blocks.

**Input Text:**
