## Target Verbosity Patterns to Remove

1. **Excessive Repetition**: Remove repeated mentions of the same term/concept (e.g., brand names mentioned 10+ times)
2. **Redundant Introductions**: Cut phrases like "In this section, we will explore..." or "This section explains..."
3. **Filler Phrases**: Remove "Here's how...", "Let's take a look at...", "It's important to note that..."
4. **Over-explanation**: Don't explain simple concepts multiple times
5. **Wordy Transitions**: Replace long transitions with concise ones
6. **Redundant Qualifiers**: Cut "very", "really", "basically", "essentially" when not adding meaning

## What to Preserve

- ALL factual information and statistics
- ALL links (internal and external)
- ALL code blocks exactly as-is
- ALL headings and document structure
- Technical details and specifications
- Examples that illustrate unique points
- The author's voice and tone

## Condensing Techniques

1. Combine related sentences that repeat information
2. Remove bullet point introductions that just restate the heading
3. Use stronger verbs instead of verb + adverb combinations
4. Convert passive voice to active voice where it shortens sentences
5. Remove "that" where grammatically optional
6. Eliminate redundant conjunctions and connectors

## Rules

- Maintain all markdown formatting
- Keep all links intact and functional
- Preserve code blocks without modification
- Keep all headings (H1, H2, H3, etc.)
- Do NOT add new content or sections
- Do NOT change the meaning of any statement
- Do NOT remove important context or nuance
