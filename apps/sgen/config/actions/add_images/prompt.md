Enhance the article by adding references to relevant images or illustrations where they improve understanding. Do not embed external image URLs unless necessary; prefer descriptive placeholders with alt text that a CMS can later resolve.

Guidelines:
- Insert markdown image blocks with clear, SEO-friendly alt text.
- Use concise, descriptive filenames or slugs (e.g., `/images/customer-journey-map.png`).
- Only add images where they add value; do not spam.
- Keep existing content intact; integrate images at logical breakpoints.
